# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
Did the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself, so we can have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.
